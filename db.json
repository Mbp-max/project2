      "description": "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.                                              HTML: HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. However, it’s worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:   Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word. Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for you.",
